# AI Health Gain — Health made visible

**What it is**  
An AI‑powered companion that turns *small lifestyle changes* into **visible health gains**.  
We start with alcohol habits and expand to other behaviors.

**Why it matters**  
Traditional advice says “quit”. Real life needs *options*.  
We provide **two supportive paths**:  
- For people who want to cut down: *see tangible gains each week*.  
- For people who still drink: *harm‑reduction tips that meaningfully lower risk.*  

**How it works (simplified)**  
1) Public‑health evidence links habits → disease risk.  
2) Survival/causal modeling estimates **expected healthy‑life years**.  
3) The app compares *keep vs improve* and shows the **difference** as a visible gain.

**Example (demo)**  
> Reducing from **4 → 2 drinking days/week** could yield **+8–12 months** of healthy life.*

*Educational demo only; not medical advice. Parameters will be calibrated with peer‑reviewed evidence and local data.*

**Design principles**  
- Positive tone, no judgement  
- Clear numbers, simple visuals  
- Privacy by design; no raw identifiers

**Pilot in Norway**  
We aim to run a **pilot study with a Norwegian academic advisor** to calibrate and validate the model for local relevance.
